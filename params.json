This approach, known as _empirical Bayes_, is both more accurate and statistically robust. It also enables more advanced analysis use cases such as sub-population detection.\r\n\r\n![Inference Accuracy](https://raw.github.com/ebfret/paper-icml/master/figures/fig_accuracy_vs_noise_v2_500dpi.png)\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n```\r\ndata = load_fret('my_data.dat');\r\neb = eb_fret(data.fret, [2,3,4], 10);\r\ntracePlotter(data.fret, 'vit', eb(3).vit);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Get the Source\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a stand-alone GUI for usage in a lab environment.
