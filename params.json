{"name":"ebFRET","tagline":"ebFRET performs combined analysis on multiple single-molecule FRET time series to learn a set of rates and states ","body":"### Consensus analysis of many single-molecule FRET time series\r\n\r\nebFRET is a library written in Matlab for the analysis of single-molecule FRET time series with hidden Markov models. \r\n\r\n![Example Traces](images/ebfret_mainwindow.png)\r\n\r\nebFRET is the successor of [vbFRET](http://vbfret.sourceforge.net), which it improves upon by performing combined analysis of multiple time series at once. This approach, known as _empirical Bayes_, is both more accurate and statistically robust. It also enables more advanced analysis use cases such as sub-population detection.\r\n\r\n### Get the Source\r\n\r\nThe ebFRET source code (with graphical user interface) can be downloaded here [[git](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui); [zip](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui/releases/)]. Please see [README](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui/blob/master/README.md) and [User Guide](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-gui/blob/master/documentation/ebfret_user_guide.pdf?raw=true) for installation instructions.  \r\n\r\nA command-line version of the code is also available for advanced analysis tasks, such as detection of subpopulations, which cannot be directly accomplished in the GUI [[git](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-script); [zip](https://github.com/ebfret/ebfret-script/archive/master.zip)].\r\n\r\nCode to plot transition density plots (TDP) as per ``Observation and Analysis of RAD51 Nucleation Dynamics at Single-Monomer Resolution'' in Methods in Enzymology by Subramanyam et al. can be found [here](https://github.com/ebfret/TransitionDensityPlots).\r\n\r\n### Papers\r\n\r\n_``Hierarchically-coupled hidden Markov models for learning kinetic rates from single-molecule data.''_\r\nJan-Willem van de Meent (@jwvdm), Jonathan E.
